            <p>Understanding the fundamentals of medical imaging techniques, from basic principles to advanced clinical applications</p>
        </div>
        <!-- 1. WHAT IS MEDICAL IMAGING? -->
        <h2>What is Medical Imaging?</h2>
        <p>
            Medical imaging is the science and technique of visualizing the interior structures and functions of the human body in a non-invasive or minimally invasive way. 
            It provides healthcare professionals with critical diagnostic information that can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. 
            These images often serve as the first step in assessing medical conditions, ranging from bone fractures to cancerous tumors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite its interdisciplinary complexity—encompassing physics, engineering, biology, and computer science—the fundamental goal of medical imaging remains the same: 
            to safely and accurately capture the anatomy (structure) and physiology (function) of the human body. 
            This article introduces key imaging techniques, explains how they work, and discusses their roles in modern clinical practice.
        </p>

        <!-- 2. COMMON MEDICAL IMAGING MODALITIES -->
        <h2>Common Medical Imaging Modalities</h2>
        <p>
            There are several core medical imaging techniques used in modern medicine. Each modality relies on different physical principles to produce images with unique 
            advantages, limitations, and levels of detail. Below is an overview of the most widely used modalities:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>X-ray Imaging (Projection Radiography):</strong><br>
                X-rays are a form of ionizing electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate tissues to varying degrees. 
                Dense materials like bone absorb more X-rays and appear brighter (white) on the resulting image, 
                whereas soft tissues appear darker. 
                Although X-ray imaging is widely used for rapid assessment of fractures and chest examinations, 
                its principal limitation is the lack of detailed soft tissue contrast.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Computed Tomography (CT):</strong><br>
                CT scanning builds upon X-ray technology by rotating an X-ray source and a detector array around the patient. 
                A computer reconstructs the multiple projections into cross-sectional (tomographic) images. 
                CT offers a more detailed three-dimensional representation of the body, 
                making it invaluable for examining complex fractures, vascular structures (using contrast agents), 
                and internal organs. 
                However, CT involves higher doses of radiation compared to standard X-rays.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):</strong><br>
                MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to image internal structures. 
                Most MRI systems operate by aligning the nuclear magnetization of hydrogen atoms (primarily in water and fat) 
                within the patient’s body. When these aligned spins are momentarily excited and subsequently relax, 
                they emit radiofrequency signals that are detected and used to construct the image. 
                MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast, making it an essential tool for neurological, orthopedic, 
                and cardiovascular imaging. 
                Despite its excellent contrast resolution, MRI has higher cost, longer scan times, 
                and is not suitable for patients with certain implants or severe claustrophobia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ultrasound:</strong><br>
                Ultrasound employs high-frequency sound waves (typically 2–15 MHz) transmitted into the body via a transducer. 
                As these waves encounter boundaries between tissues of different acoustic impedances, 
                they are partially reflected back to the transducer. 
                By measuring the time and intensity of these echoes, a real-time image is formed. 
                Ultrasound is safe (no ionizing radiation), cost-effective, and portable, 
                making it ideal for examining soft tissue structures such as the heart (echocardiography), 
                abdominal organs, and for guiding minimally invasive procedures. 
                However, image quality and depth penetration can be limited, especially in obese patients or areas obstructed by gas or bone.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Positron Emission Tomography (PET):</strong><br>
                PET visualizes metabolic and biochemical activity in the body by detecting pairs of gamma rays emitted when a positron (from a radioactive tracer) collides with an electron. 
                The radioactive tracer, typically attached to a molecule like glucose (e.g., <sup>18</sup>F-FDG), localizes to areas of high metabolic activity, such as tumors. 
                PET is often combined with CT or MRI in hybrid scanners (e.g., PET/CT, PET/MRI) to co-register functional and anatomical information, 
                significantly improving lesion detection and diagnosis in oncology, neurology, and cardiology.
            </li>
        </ul>
