        <!-- 1. WHAT IS FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS? -->
        <h2>What is Frequency Domain Analysis?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Frequency domain analysis</strong> is an approach to image processing and interpretation 
            that focuses on an image's <em>frequency components</em> rather than its direct spatial (pixel-by-pixel) representation. 
            By transforming an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain (for example, using the Fourier Transform), 
            it becomes possible to isolate and manipulate specific frequency bands, 
            offering powerful methods for filtering, compression, and feature extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the frequency domain, an image is described in terms of sinusoidal patterns with different frequencies. 
            Low-frequency components typically correspond to smooth variations or “coarse” structures (e.g., background or gradual intensity changes), 
            while high-frequency components capture abrupt changes such as edges, fine details, and noise. 
            By selectively boosting or suppressing these frequencies, we can perform a range of operations 
            that might be more complex or computationally costly in the spatial domain.
        </p>

        <!-- 2. WHY USE FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS? -->
        <h2>Why Use Frequency Domain Analysis?</h2>
        <p>
            The primary advantage of the frequency domain is the ability to target specific frequency ranges, 
            giving fine-grained control over how the image is enhanced, compressed, or filtered. Key benefits include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Noise Reduction:</strong><br>
                Many types of image noise occur at high frequencies. 
                Applying a <em>low-pass filter</em> in the frequency domain can effectively suppress these noise components 
                without overly blurring the entire image.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Image Enhancement:</strong><br>
                By boosting certain frequency bands, important features such as edges or repetitive textures can be emphasized. 
                <em>High-pass filters</em> are commonly used to sharpen images by selectively amplifying high-frequency details.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Compression:</strong><br>
                Formats like JPEG exploit the fact that many images contain significant low-frequency energy and relatively fewer crucial high-frequency components. 
                By transforming the image and quantizing these frequencies, efficient compression can be achieved with minimal perceptual loss.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong><br>
                Periodic or repetitive patterns (e.g., textures, regular structures) are often easier to identify in the frequency domain, 
                making it useful for tasks like object recognition or fault detection in industrial settings.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 3. FOURIER TRANSFORM -->
        <h2>Fourier Transform</h2>
        <p>
            The most common mathematical tool for converting an image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain is the 
            <strong>Fourier Transform (FT)</strong>. In image processing, we generally use the 
            <strong>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</strong>, which is efficiently computed via the 
            <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong> algorithm.
        </p>

        <h3>Mathematical Representation</h3>
        <p>
            For a 2D image \( f(x,y) \) of size \( M \times N \), the 2D DFT is given by:
        </p>
        <pre>
F(u,v) = ∑(x=0 to M-1) ∑(y=0 to N-1) f(x,y) · e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))
        </pre>
        <p>
            Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                \( f(x,y) \) is the image in the spatial domain (pixel values).
            </li>
            <li>
                \( F(u,v) \) is the resulting complex-valued function in the frequency domain. 
                The magnitudes |F(u,v)| often indicate how strongly a particular frequency contributes to the image, 
                while the phase carries spatial positioning information.
            </li>
            <li>
                \( (u, v) \) are the frequency coordinates.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In practice, we often apply a “shift” to center the low-frequency components around the origin for better visualization, 
            referred to as <code>fftshift</code> in many software libraries.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. COMMON FREQUENCY DOMAIN FILTERS -->
        <h2>Common Frequency Domain Filters</h2>
        <p>
            Once an image is transformed into the frequency domain, filters can be designed to manipulate specific frequency ranges. 
            Broadly, these filters are categorized as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Low-Pass Filters:</strong><br>
                Allow low frequencies to pass while attenuating high frequencies. 
                These filters produce smoothed or blurred versions of the image. 
                They are useful for noise reduction when the noise is primarily in the high-frequency range.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>High-Pass Filters:</strong><br>
                Preserve high-frequency content, such as edges and fine details, while suppressing low-frequency background. 
                This is a common approach for edge enhancement and sharpening.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Band-Pass Filters:</strong><br>
                Retain a specific range (band) of frequencies while suppressing others. 
                Band-pass filters are often employed for texture analysis or to isolate periodic patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Notch Filters:</strong><br>
                A special case of band-stop filtering that targets very specific frequency peaks, 
                often to remove unwanted periodic interference or noise (e.g., “stripes” from sensor artifacts).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 5. IMPLEMENTATION IN PYTHON -->
        <h2>Implementation in Python</h2>
        <p>
            Below is an example demonstrating how to perform a 2D Fourier Transform on a grayscale image using 
            <strong>NumPy</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong>. We also show how to visualize the magnitude spectrum, 
            which helps in understanding the frequency composition of the image.

        <!-- 6. APPLICATIONS OF FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS -->
        <h2>Applications of Frequency Domain Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Frequency domain techniques are widely utilized in diverse fields where image quality, efficiency, and structured patterns are critical:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Medical Imaging:</strong><br>
                Noise reduction in modalities like MRI or CT scans, as well as contrast enhancement for diagnostic clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remote Sensing:</strong><br>
                Analysis of satellite imagery to detect repeating terrain patterns or to remove high-frequency noise caused by sensor artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR):</strong><br>
                Preprocessing text documents to enhance character boundaries and reduce backgrounds or unwanted artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Image Compression:</strong><br>
                Exploitation of frequency sparsity underpins many compression algorithms, most notably JPEG, which applies a block-wise DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Forensic and Security Applications:</strong><br>
                Detecting tampering artifacts or hidden watermarks by inspecting anomalies in the frequency domain.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 7. CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS -->
        <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            While frequency domain analysis is extraordinarily powerful, it is not without complications:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Computational Complexity:</strong><br>
                For very large images (e.g., high-resolution medical or satellite imagery), computing a 2D FFT and subsequent filtering 
                can be computationally expensive, although efficient FFT algorithms and GPU acceleration can help mitigate this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Filter Design Artifacts:</strong><br>
                Improperly designed frequency domain filters (e.g., abrupt cutoffs in ideal low/high-pass filters) 
                can introduce ringing or other artifacts in the spatial domain. 
                Carefully choosing smoother filters (e.g., Butterworth or Gaussian filters) can reduce these artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Loss of Spatial Localization:</strong><br>
                The global nature of the Fourier Transform means that local features become “spread” across frequency bins, 
                making it harder to pinpoint where specific changes occurred in the image. 
                Techniques like wavelet transforms or short-time Fourier transforms are sometimes preferred for better spatial-frequency localization.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Phase Information:</strong><br>
                Most visual analyses focus on the magnitude spectrum, but the phase contains critical information about the positional relationships of features. 
                Ignoring phase can limit the effectiveness of certain processing tasks.
            </li>
        </ul>
