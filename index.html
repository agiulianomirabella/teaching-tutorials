        <h2>What is Medical Imaging?</h2>
        <p>Medical imaging is the process of creating visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. It allows healthcare professionals to diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>Common Medical Imaging Modalities</h2>
        <p>There are several types of medical imaging techniques used in modern medicine, each with unique advantages and applications:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>X-ray Imaging:</strong> Uses ionizing radiation to produce images of dense structures like bones.</li>
            <li><strong>Computed Tomography (CT):</strong> Combines multiple X-ray images to create cross-sectional views of the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):</strong> Uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of soft tissues.</li>
            <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> Uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of internal organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Positron Emission Tomography (PET):</strong> Visualizes metabolic processes by detecting radioactive tracers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Medical Imaging</h2>
        <p>Medical imaging is used in a variety of clinical applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diagnosis of diseases and conditions (e.g., fractures, tumors, organ abnormalities)</li>
            <li>Guidance during surgical procedures</li>
            <li>Monitoring disease progression and treatment response</li>
            <li>Preventive healthcare through routine screening</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits and Limitations</h2>
        <p>While medical imaging offers numerous advantages, such as non-invasive diagnosis and improved patient care, it also has limitations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Early detection of diseases, improved treatment planning, and enhanced patient safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Exposure to radiation (in X-ray and CT), cost, and potential for image artifacts affecting diagnosis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future of Medical Imaging</h2>
        <p>The field of medical imaging is rapidly evolving with advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), 3D imaging, and personalized diagnostics, promising improved accuracy and efficiency in healthcare.</p>
